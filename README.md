# MapBuilder
MapBuilder provides streamlined control over the ArcPy (ArcGIS) Python module.  The goal is to make it easier to make polished
maps using a wide variety of data inputs.  Typical ArcGIS projects are painless to setup, explore, and reproduce using
updated data.

## How It Works
MapBuilder projects have a certain directory structure that makes this all possible.  The templates directory contains example bootstrap 
files demonstrating common usage.  Each example (COMING SOON) should run on most machines without making any changes, other than the path
to your MapBuilder directory.
